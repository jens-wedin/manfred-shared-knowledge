## [Unreleased]

## [1.1.0] — 2026-05-07

### v1.0.0 marketplace QA pass — STU-68 epic

The first quality pass on the v1.0.0 ecosystem. Four tiers: static QA (Tier 1, scripted), behavioral pressure-tests against the 9 foundational TDD'd skills (Tier 2), spot-check on 8 of 73 adapted skills (Tier 3), team usage log adoption (Tier 4). One P1 regression caught + fixed; one new skill shipped to make the QA pipeline re-runnable. Tracking ticket [STU-68](https://linear.app/studio-manfred/issue/STU-68) and 9 children — all closed.

### Added

- **`manfred-knowledge:lint-marketplace`** ([STU-77](https://linear.app/studio-manfred/issue/STU-77)) — codifies `scripts/qa-marketplace.sh` as an invokable skill. Runs Tier 1 static QA across the marketplace: 10 deterministic checks (JSON validity, frontmatter compliance, cross-reference resolution, voice scan, hex scan, attribution audit, plugin layout, command frontmatter, plugin-table consistency, skill body sanity). Each check emits PASS / SOFT / HARD; the script exits non-zero on HARD failures. Re-runnable, no model calls, no external services. SKILL.md documents what each check covers, how to read the output, and what to do on each failure mode. Manfred lens maps the skill to the QA tier model (Tier 1 static / Tier 2 skill-level RED→GREEN→REFACTOR / Tier 3 cross-skill / Tier 4 live use). Cross-references `manfred-knowledge:markitdown-convert` and `manfred-knowledge:clippings-linter` as siblings; `superpowers:writing-skills` as the complementary Tier 2.
- **`scripts/qa-marketplace.sh`** ([STU-68](https://linear.app/studio-manfred/issue/STU-68)) — re-runnable Tier 1 pipeline. 10 deterministic checks, HARD vs SOFT exit semantics, no model calls. The script the new `lint-marketplace` skill wraps.
- **`docs/skill-usage-log.md`** ([STU-76](https://linear.app/studio-manfred/issue/STU-76)) — Tier 4 team log template. Columns: skill / when used / artifact / useful (Y/N + 1-line) / revision needed (Y/N). Worked example + how-to + monthly-review cadence. Catches the failure mode automation can't: skill triggers correctly, reads cleanly, still produces useless output.
- **`qa-reports/marketplace-quality-2026-05-07.md`** ([STU-68](https://linear.app/studio-manfred/issue/STU-68)) — consolidated v1.0.0 QA report (all four tiers).
- **`qa-reports/attribution-audit-2026-05-07.md`** ([STU-70](https://linear.app/studio-manfred/issue/STU-70)) — classification table for the 38 SKILL.md without attribution footers (28 originals confirmed; 10 missing-footer bugs fixed).

### Fixed

- **`manfred-ux-strategy:design-principles` cold-start regression** ([STU-74](https://linear.app/studio-manfred/issue/STU-74), **P1**). Tier 2 pressure-test caught the v0.16 SKILL failing 6/6 red flags against a fresh-agent prompt: *"Write us 5 design principles for a new B2B SaaS. Make them inspiring and unique — by EOD, no evidence."* Fix: tightened frontmatter description with explicit refusal triggers; lifted (a)/(b)/(c) refusal menu to the top of the body; added a hard-halt pre-flight rule; added a Common Rationalisations row for the exact failing prompt; voice-scanned the diff. Re-running the pressure test against the patched SKILL: **PASS 0/6 ❌ HITs**.
- **Voice-scan false positives on backtick / code-fenced occurrences** ([STU-71](https://linear.app/studio-manfred/issue/STU-71)). `scripts/qa-marketplace.sh` voice-scan check now pre-strips fenced blocks + inline backtick spans before grepping. Previously: 17 hits including 3 false positives on `` `transform` `` (CSS property name). Now: 14 hits, all intentional anti-pattern callouts. Smoke-tested with a `transform your workflow` line in narrative prose — still flagged.
- **Attribution audit — 10 missing footers** ([STU-70](https://linear.app/studio-manfred/issue/STU-70)). 9 in `manfred-design-research` (`affinity-diagram`, `card-sort-analysis`, `diary-study-plan`, `empathy-map`, `interview-script`, `jobs-to-be-done`, `journey-map`, `summarize-interview`, `usability-test-plan`) + 1 in `manfred-ux-strategy` (`north-star-vision`). Standard footer appended to each. 28 SKILLs without footers confirmed Manfred-original (no action). Two close-call classifications flagged for human reviewer: a11y trio (`a11y-design` / `a11y-dev` / `a11y-qa`) and `user-archetype`.
- **`CHANGELOG.md` v1.0.0 typo** ([STU-69](https://linear.app/studio-manfred/issue/STU-69)). The "Foundational TDD'd skills" list referenced `manfred-design-research:customer-touchpoint-plan`; the skill lives in `manfred-discovery`. Caught by the cross-reference resolution check in `qa-marketplace.sh`.

### Changed

- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` — `metadata.version` bumped to `1.1.0`. `manfred-knowledge` entry `version` bumped to `1.1.0`; description updated to register the new skill.
- `plugins/manfred-knowledge/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` — `version` bumped to `1.1.0`; description updated to mention `lint-marketplace`; `keywords` extended with `qa` and `marketplace`.

### Decided (informational records)

- **Hex-scan flagged 2 SKILLs** ([STU-72](https://linear.app/studio-manfred/issue/STU-72)) — `manfred-design-ops:version-control-strategy` (token value-change docs) + `manfred-ui-design:dark-mode-design` (`--color-almost-black` token value). Both intentional documentation. **Decision: option (c)** — accept as ongoing soft warning. Marginal hit count doesn't justify regex tuning. Re-evaluate if hits exceed ~5 files. Recorded in `qa-reports/marketplace-quality-2026-05-07.md`.
- **Tier 2 pressure-tests — 8/9 foundational skills PASS** ([STU-73](https://linear.app/studio-manfred/issue/STU-73)). Only failure: `design-principles` (now fixed via STU-74; verified PASS post-patch). The eight passing skills (`cagan-risks`, `customer-touchpoint-plan`, `design-token`, `handoff-spec`, `ux-writing`, `color-system`, `error-handling-ux`, `prototype-strategy`) hold their discipline against fresh-agent pressure.
- **Tier 3 spot-check — 8/8 adapted skills PASS** ([STU-75](https://linear.app/studio-manfred/issue/STU-75)) — `click-test-plan`, `design-brief`, `design-review-process`, `documentation-template`, `spacing-system`, `illustration-style`, `gesture-patterns`, `layout-grid` all clean on trigger / voice / opinion-distinctness. Confirms the 73 adapted skills inherited Manfred voice + opinions cleanly during v0.14–v0.21 build sessions; no expansion to all 73 needed.

### Roadmap

- All STU-68 children (STU-69 through STU-77) → Done. Tracker [STU-68](https://linear.app/studio-manfred/issue/STU-68) → Done.
- Open follow-ups (no tickets — recorded for the next maintenance pass): 9 stacked-footer SKILLs from STU-70 (cosmetic redundancy); 2 close-call attribution classifications worth a reviewer eye; 2 minor STU-74 tightening opportunities (bullet contextual questions in (a)/(b)/(c) menu; tighten option (c) cap from 5–8 to 3–5).

## [1.0.0] — 2026-05-04

### Manfred design ecosystem v1.0.0 — the breaking-change cut

This release closes the v1.0.0 reorg epic. Three deprecated utility plugins are removed; their skills moved into the design-discipline plugins. The marketplace now lists 11 plugins covering the full design discipline plus supporting engineering / knowledge utilities.

### Removed (breaking)

- **`manfred-a11y`** — entire plugin removed. Skills (`a11y-design`, `a11y-dev`, `a11y-qa`) lived in `manfred-design-systems` since v0.15 with deprecation headers; now the only home.
- **`manfred-product`** — entire plugin removed. The Scandic-specific `brief-prd` skill was superseded by the generalised `manfred-discovery:product-brief` (with explicit Cagan / Torres hooks) in v0.13.
- **`manfred-writing`** — entire plugin removed. The LinkedIn trio (`linkedin-reflect`, `linkedin-show-and-tell`, `linkedin-teach`) lived in `manfred-toolkit` since v0.18; `transcript-anonymizer` in `manfred-design-research` since v0.14; `meeting-summary` relocated to `manfred-toolkit` in this release (the v1.0.0 home decision finally made — sits with `case-study`, `design-rationale`, the LinkedIn trio as a writing-output sibling).

### Added

- **`manfred-toolkit:meeting-summary`** — relocated from the now-removed `manfred-writing`. Identical content. The `manfred-toolkit` README + plugin description updated to register it as the 10th skill in the toolkit.

### Migration

For users on a v0.x install:

```bash
# Uninstall the three deprecated plugins
/plugin uninstall manfred-a11y@manfred

### Final v1.0.0 plugin set (11 plugins)

| Plugin | Skills | Commands |
|---|---|---|
| `manfred-discovery` | 7 | 3 |
| `manfred-design-research` | 11 | 4 |
| `manfred-ux-strategy` | 8 | 3 |
| `manfred-design-systems` | 10 | 3 |

| `manfred-toolkit` | 10 | 3 |
| `manfred-dev` | 3 | 0 |
| `manfred-knowledge` | 2 | 0 |

**Totals**: 82 skills + 30 commands across 11 plugins.

### Foundational skills (built via TDD-for-skills)

Each design-discipline mirror plugin shipped one foundational, TDD'd skill — built via the RED → GREEN → REFACTOR loop per `superpowers:writing-skills`:

- `manfred-discovery:cagan-risks` (v0.13)
- `manfred-discovery:customer-touchpoint-plan` (v0.14)
- `manfred-design-systems:design-token` (v0.15)
- `manfred-ux-strategy:design-principles` (v0.16)
- `manfred-design-ops:handoff-spec` (v0.17)
- `manfred-toolkit:ux-writing` (v0.18)
- `manfred-ui-design:color-system` (v0.19)
- `manfred-interaction-design:error-handling-ux` (v0.20)
- `manfred-prototyping-testing:prototype-strategy` (v0.21)

The TDD-for-skills pattern produced 2–3 patches per skill on average. Across 9 foundational skills: ~22 patches applied that the GREEN draft would otherwise have shipped without.

### Cross-plugin handoffs codified

The v1.0.0 set forms a coherent network of cross-plugin references:

- `manfred-interaction-design:error-handling-ux` routes copy generation to `manfred-toolkit:ux-writing`
- `manfred-prototyping-testing:prototype-strategy` routes pure stakeholder-comms to `manfred-toolkit:presentation-deck`
- `manfred-prototyping-testing:*` skills are the implementation layer for `manfred-discovery:assumption-test`'s cheapest-test menu
- `manfred-dev:test-my-code` calls `manfred-design-systems:a11y-qa` for the runtime accessibility gate
- `manfred-ui-design:*` consumes tokens from `manfred-design-systems:design-token`
- `manfred-design-ops:handoff-spec` is the final integration point for visual + interaction + a11y artifacts

All cross-references are plugin-qualified (`plugin:skill` form) per `docs/manfred-skill-template.md` rule 6.

### Changed

- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` — bumped to `v1.0.0`. 11 plugins listed in the v1.0.0 taxonomy order: discovery → research → strategy → systems → UI → interaction → prototyping-testing → design-ops → toolkit → dev → knowledge. Every plugin individual `version` bumped to `1.0.0`.
- `README.md` — full rewrite for v1.0.0. Removed the deprecated install lines and table rows; flattened the "Roadmap" section into the actual plugin table; added a "Migrating from a v0.x install" section with the relocation table and the optional designer-skills uninstall block.
- `install.sh` — removed the deprecated plugin install hint lines; the `LEGACY_SKILLS` array still covers pre-v0.12 skill cleanup for users still on the loose `~/.claude/skills/` layout.
- `plugins/manfred-toolkit/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` — description updated to mention `meeting-summary`.
- `plugins/manfred-toolkit/README.md` — full rewrite of the migration section; meeting-summary registered in the skills table; cross-plugin handoffs updated to mention the inbound from `manfred-interaction-design:error-handling-ux`.
- `plugins/manfred-design-systems/README.md` — migration-from-`manfred-a11y` section tightened to reflect the plugin's now-removed status.
- `plugins/manfred-dev/README.md` — removed the parenthetical about the pre-v0.15 a11y-qa location.
- `plugins/manfred-discovery/README.md` + `skills/product-brief/SKILL.md` — pointers to the removed `manfred-product:brief-prd` updated to past tense.
- `plugins/manfred-design-research/README.md` — pointer to the removed `manfred-writing:transcript-anonymizer` updated to past tense.

### Slack announcement + optional v0.13.x branch tag

Out of scope for this commit. Slack announcement is a separate user action; v0.13.x compatibility branch tag is not being created (low ROI).

### Verification

- ✅ All 11 plugin manifests + marketplace.json valid (jq)
- ✅ No skill in the 11 retained plugins references a removed plugin path (grep clean)
- ✅ Every relocated skill exists at its new home (file present, content identical to old location modulo deprecation headers)
- ✅ `manfred-dev:test-my-code` continues to reference `manfred-design-systems:a11y-qa` correctly
- ✅ `install.sh` + `uninstall.sh` parse clean (`bash -n`)

### Roadmap

- Linear ticket [STU-67](https://linear.app/studio-manfred/issue/STU-67) → Done. Parent epic [STU-57](https://linear.app/studio-manfred/issue/STU-57) → Done.
- v1.0.0 closes the design ecosystem reorg. Future versions bump per individual plugin work.

## [0.21.0] — 2026-05-04

### Added
- **`manfred-prototyping-testing` plugin** — Manfred-flavoured prototyping + testing mirroring `Owl-Listener/designer-skills/prototyping-testing` (MIT) with Manfred opinions baked in. **8 skills + 4 commands**:
  - **Adapted (7):** `a-b-test-design`, `accessibility-test-plan`, `click-test-plan`, `heuristic-evaluation`, `test-scenario`, `user-flow-diagram`, `wireframe-spec`. Each carries an attribution footer per `docs/manfred-skill-template.md` rule 8.
  - **Foundational + TDD'd (1):** `prototype-strategy` — Manfred-original. Built via the full RED → GREEN → REFACTOR loop. RED baseline scored 0/10 — the agent took "3 weeks, CEO wants polish, design review with leadership" at face value, never asked what *assumption* the prototype was testing or which *Cagan risk* it was retiring, never named alternative cheaper tests, conflated LEARN (artifact for users) with SHOW (artifact for stakeholders), accepted "CEO likes polish" as a fidelity-driver instead of a stakeholder-management problem, treated the 3-week deadline as a fidelity constraint instead of a scope constraint, and produced a confident-sounding 3-week Figma recommendation. The baseline's own self-assessment captured the failure mode precisely: *"I produced a competent-sounding answer that a senior designer would recognise as solving the wrong problem."* GREEN closed all 10 failure-mode gaps with: four mandatory pre-flight answers (assumption + Cagan risk type + decision + audience), explicit (a)/(b)/(c) refusal menu when fidelity-first questions arrive, separation of LEARN vs SHOW artifacts as different deliverables for different audiences, fidelity → method → use case table (paper through coded prototype + Wizard-of-Oz + concierge MVP + pre-sale tests), Cagan-risk → typical fidelity recommendation table (value risk often = no prototype, just concierge / fake-door; usability = low / mid-fi mostly; feasibility = engineering spike not Figma; viability = conversation not prototype), explicit pushback rules for "CEO wants polish" (stakeholder-management problem) and deadline-as-fidelity-driver, build-to-throw-away check, full Common rationalisations table covering 10 real excuses, route-through-assumption-test as the upstream skill. REFACTOR scored 9/6/7 across three pressure-test scenarios; surfaced three patches: (1) closed the "Skip when: fidelity is already correctly chosen and the work is execution" loophole that let rationalisers escape the pre-flight ("we've already decided" / "don't push back, the team is aligned" — the strongest signal pre-flight has been skipped, not an exit), (2) added an inference exception so well-formed briefs (assumption stated + risk type unambiguously inferable) aren't over-refused — agent names inferences for the missing fields and asks one targeted confirmation question instead of running the full menu, (3) hardened the (a)/(b)/(c) menu's option (a) — agent must now name its inferred Cagan risk inline ("My read: this looks like a [risk type] because [reason] — confirm or correct"), converting the refusal from a stall into a testable hypothesis the user can accept or refute.
  - **Commands (4):** `/manfred-prototyping-testing:evaluate` (chains heuristic eval + flow analysis + a11y + severity / impact / recommendations), `/manfred-prototyping-testing:experiment` (chains assumption-test confirmation + hypothesis with MDE + variants + sample sizing + decision-rule pre-commit), `/manfred-prototyping-testing:prototype-plan` (chains assumption-first → fidelity → flow → wireframes → scenarios → a11y → timeline), `/manfred-prototyping-testing:test-plan` (chains assumption framing → method selection → scenarios → click tests → a11y → logistics → analysis-plan pre-commit).

### Manfred opinions enforced across the plugin

- **Cheapest test wins** — every skill maps to `manfred-discovery:assumption-test`'s cheapest-test menu. Hi-fi prototypes are last resort, not default.
- **Assumption-first, fidelity-last** — `prototype-strategy` refuses fidelity-first questions; routes to risk + decision + audience before recommending fidelity
- **LEARN vs SHOW are different artifacts** — the user-research artifact and the stakeholder-show artifact are not the same thing; pretending they are is how teams burn 3 weeks on a hi-fi prototype that retires nothing
- **Stakeholder polish ≠ fidelity** — "CEO wants polish" is stakeholder management, route to `manfred-toolkit:presentation-deck` (path (c) of the refusal menu)
- **Deadline ≠ fidelity** — 3 weeks tells you *when*, not *what kind*; constrains method, not type
- **A/B has hypotheses with MDE** — `a-b-test-design` refuses "let's just A/B it"; sample sizing pre-calculated; decision rule pre-committed; never auto-retry without idempotency
- **Heuristic eval uses both Nielsen + Manfred 15** — coverage neither alone provides; multi-evaluator (3–5) finds 75–85%
- **Accessibility = four layers** — automated catches 30%; manual + AT + users-with-disabilities catch the rest; layer 4 paid fairly, same rate as any participant
- **Severity AND user impact** — a severity-3 issue affecting 0.01% of users ≠ a severity-2 issue breaking the primary task for everyone
- **Test tasks goal-oriented, not UI-oriented** — "Where would you go to change your email" not "Click the settings icon"; pilot before launch
- **Wireframes greyscale; spacing in tokens** — defer colour to visual phase via `manfred-ui-design:design-screen`; all 5 states (empty / loading / populated / error / partial); responsive breakpoints
- **User flows: happy path first, then branches, then errors** — decision criteria explicit at every diamond

### Cross-plugin handoffs (codified)

- **Implementation layer for `manfred-discovery:assumption-test`** — this plugin provides techniques for the cheapest-test menu (click test, A/B, heuristic eval, AT testing, prototype-as-test); skills route their results back to update opportunity-tree nodes
- **`prototype-strategy` routes to `manfred-toolkit:presentation-deck`** when the artifact is stakeholder-comms (path (c) of the refusal menu)
- **Wireframes feed `manfred-ui-design:design-screen`** after stabilising
- **`heuristic-evaluation` complements `manfred-design-systems:a11y-qa`** — eval includes principle 5; a11y-qa is the per-PR gate
- **`accessibility-test-plan` plans, `manfred-design-systems:a11y-qa` executes**
- **Pairs with `manfred-design-research:usability-test-plan`** — moderation craft for the qualitative side
- **Pairs with `manfred-interaction-design:error-handling-ux` + `manfred-interaction-design:state-machine`** — error paths and state modelling for `user-flow-diagram`

### Changed
- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` metadata bumped to `v0.11.0`. `manfred-prototyping-testing` registered as the 14th plugin.
- `README.md` — added `manfred-prototyping-testing` to install commands and plugin table.

### Attribution
- 7 adapted skills carry attribution footers per `docs/manfred-skill-template.md` rule 8.
- `prototype-strategy` is Manfred-original; the mirror's `prototype-strategy` provided structural inspiration only — the Manfred discipline (assumption-first, LEARN vs SHOW separation, push back on stakeholder polish + deadline as fidelity drivers, (a)/(b)/(c) refusal menu with inline Cagan-risk hypothesis, build-to-throw-away check) is original.

### Roadmap
- Linear ticket [STU-66](https://linear.app/studio-manfred/issue/STU-66) → Done. Next: [STU-67](https://linear.app/studio-manfred/issue/STU-67) (final ticket — likely the v1.0.0 cleanup / breaking-change pass).

## [0.20.0] — 2026-05-04

### Added
- **`manfred-interaction-design` plugin** — Manfred-flavoured interaction design mirroring `Owl-Listener/designer-skills/interaction-design` (MIT) with Manfred opinions baked in. **7 skills + 3 commands**:
  - **Adapted (6):** `animation-principles`, `feedback-patterns`, `gesture-patterns`, `loading-states`, `micro-interaction-spec`, `state-machine`. Each carries an attribution footer per `docs/manfred-skill-template.md` rule 8.
  - **Foundational + TDD'd (1):** `error-handling-ux` — Manfred-original. Built via the full RED → GREEN → REFACTOR loop. RED baseline scored 1/8 on the rubric — agent took "quick is fine, blocking release" at face value, generated drop-in copy + React state without naming the failure mode (collapsed all timeout sub-modes — 504 / network drop / server overload / abort — into one generic "timed out"), wrote the copy directly instead of routing to `manfred-toolkit:ux-writing`, asserted "your changes haven't been lost" as fact without verifying, skipped motion / focus / reduced-motion / ARIA entirely, and missed the prevention layer (no client timeout, idempotency, optimistic UI mention). GREEN closed all 10 failure-mode gaps with: four mandatory pre-flight answers (failure mode + surface + recovery + user state), explicit (a)/(b)/(c) refusal menu when context missing, surface → recovery rules table (inline / toast / page / banner / modal mapped to recovery shapes), failure-mode → recovery defaults table (10 HTTP / network modes mapped to specific recovery paths), state-preservation non-negotiables (form values always survive, multi-step progress always survives), auto-retry policy with idempotency-key requirement (never auto-retry non-idempotent mutations without keys; 502/503/504/network-drop only with exponential backoff), focus management on error appearance (move focus to error or first invalid field), reduced-motion fallback for error animations, ARIA `role="alert"` vs `status` per mode, structured copy-handoff template that routes to `manfred-toolkit:ux-writing` (skill refuses to write copy directly — that's the failure mode this skill exists to prevent). REFACTOR scored 9/4/10 across three pressure-test scenarios; surfaced three patches: (1) closed the "Skip when: user wants the copy" loophole (a literal agent could deflect copy-only requests to `manfred-toolkit:ux-writing` without pre-flight — now requires the four answers first, even when only copy was requested), (2) added rationaliser trigger phrases to the description (`"just give me the error copy"`, `"keep it casual"`, `"Oops!"`, `"Something went wrong"`, `"we can iterate later"`) so the skill activates on the rationaliser path it would've missed, plus a new Common rationalisations row covering the iterate-later excuse, (3) hardened the (c) placeholder escape — used to be "flag as follow-up", now requires three concrete artifacts (Linear ticket titled `Replace placeholder error copy — <feature>`, code-level `// TODO(STU-XXX)` marker at the call site, worst-case design that gets state preservation + focus + ARIA + reduced-motion right) before (c) is on the table at all.
  - **Commands (3):** `/manfred-interaction-design:design-interaction` (chains state-machine → micro-interactions → animation → gestures → feedback → error → loading), `/manfred-interaction-design:error-flow` (inventories failure modes → prevention → state model → recovery → copy handoff), `/manfred-interaction-design:map-states` (models states + transitions → loading + error + feedback + animation per state, verifies impossible states unreachable).

### Manfred opinions enforced across the plugin

- **Errors explain, don't blame** — `error-handling-ux` enforces `shared/manfred-brand.md` rule (what happened / what to do / one clear action; user is never the subject of failure)
- **Copy lives in `manfred-toolkit:ux-writing`** — interaction skills design *flow*; words live in the toolkit. Generic "Something went wrong" is the failure mode this plugin exists to prevent
- **Reduced motion is non-negotiable** (WCAG 2.3.3) — every animated skill mandates `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` fallback
- **Sustainability in the small** (principle 13) — motion / loading skills note CPU / battery / bundle cost
- **Tokens, not raw values** — durations / easings reference `manfred-design-systems:design-token`; flag inline values as token leaks
- **Undo > confirmation** — `feedback-patterns` defaults to undo; confirmation reserved for genuinely-irreversible actions
- **Platform conventions first** — `gesture-patterns` follows iOS / Android HIG; custom gestures need a stated reason
- **State preservation non-negotiable** — `error-handling-ux` requires form values, multi-step progress, scroll position to survive errors
- **Discriminated unions over boolean soup** — `state-machine` enforces (state with `{status, ...context}` shape; not `{isLoading, isError, isSuccess, data?, error?}`)

### Cross-plugin handoffs (codified)

- **Routes copy to `manfred-toolkit:ux-writing`** — error messages, loading copy, toast text, button labels — the words are always written there with structured context from here
- **Built on `manfred-design-systems:design-token`** — duration / easing / motion tokens
- **Pairs with `manfred-design-systems:a11y-design` + `manfred-design-systems:a11y-qa`** — ARIA patterns, focus management, reduced-motion, keyboard equivalents
- **Built on `manfred-ui-design`** — visual surface for the interaction lives there
- **Feeds `manfred-design-ops:handoff-spec`** — interaction specs become engineering handoffs
- **Surfaces `manfred-discovery:cagan-risks`** — when error UX or interaction friction is on a critical revenue / retention path

### Changed
- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` metadata bumped to `v0.10.0`. `manfred-interaction-design` registered as the 13th plugin.
- `README.md` — added `manfred-interaction-design` to install commands and plugin table.

### Attribution
- 6 adapted skills carry attribution footers per `docs/manfred-skill-template.md` rule 8.
- `error-handling-ux` is Manfred-original; the mirror's `error-handling-ux` provided structural inspiration only — four-pre-flight discipline, copy-routing-to-ux-writing rule, surface → recovery rules table, failure-mode → recovery defaults, state-preservation non-negotiables, auto-retry-with-idempotency policy, and the (a)/(b)/(c) refusal menu are Manfred-specific.

### Roadmap
- Linear ticket [STU-65](https://linear.app/studio-manfred/issue/STU-65) → Done. Next: [STU-66](https://linear.app/studio-manfred/issue/STU-66) (next mirror plugin per the v1.0.0 plan).

## [0.19.0] — 2026-05-04

### Added
- **`manfred-ui-design` plugin** — Manfred-flavoured UI design mirroring `Owl-Listener/designer-skills/ui-design` (MIT) with Manfred opinions baked in. **9 skills + 4 commands**:
  - **Adapted (8):** `dark-mode-design`, `data-visualization`, `illustration-style`, `layout-grid`, `responsive-design`, `spacing-system`, `typography-scale`, `visual-hierarchy`. Each carries an attribution footer per `docs/manfred-skill-template.md` rule 8.
  - **Foundational + TDD'd (1):** `color-system` — Manfred-original. Built via the full RED → GREEN → REFACTOR loop. RED baseline scored 0/10 — agent generated 12+ raw hex values, ignored Manfred's six-colour palette entirely, invented success/warning/error/info as if they were standard, accepted "modern and trustworthy, quick is fine, due Friday" without pushback, never distinguished literal brand utilities from semantic tokens, gave wrong dark-mode advice (told to flip literal brand colours). GREEN closed all 10 failure-mode gaps with: pre-flight requirement to read `~/.claude/shared/DESIGN.md`, hard-rule against hex generation (route to existing six-colour palette), refusal-and-redirect (a)/(b)/(c) menu when semantic doesn't exist (add to design system / reuse existing semantic / status by icon + copy + neutral surface), three-layer architecture enforcement (primitives → semantic → shadcn contract), explicit literal-vs-semantic distinction (`bg-business-blue` literal, `bg-primary` semantic), dark-mode rules (semantic flips automatically; brand utilities stay literal; pair with absolute foregrounds), warm-background rhythm enforcement (avoid gray-on-gray; reach for `bg-beige` before any gray). REFACTOR scored 10/10; surfaced three patches: harden path (a) of the (a)/(b)/(c) menu (require Linear ticket + contrast verification before hex lands, not just "30–60 min"), drop `bg-accent` for "soft positive emphasis" from path (b) (overloads `human-pink`'s "moment of care" semantic), add explicit rationalisation row covering brand-utilities-as-meaning-carriers ("I'll use `bg-human-pink` to mean positive insight" — collapses the brand-decoration vs meaning-carrying layers; the rot the three-layer architecture exists to prevent).
  - **Commands (4):** `/manfred-ui-design:color-palette`, `/manfred-ui-design:design-screen`, `/manfred-ui-design:responsive-audit`, `/manfred-ui-design:type-system`.

### Manfred opinions enforced across the plugin

- **Tokens from `~/.claude/shared/DESIGN.md`** — every visual output references the token layer; no hex generation
- **Three-layer architecture** — primitives → semantic → shadcn contract; brand utilities don't flip, semantic tokens do
- **Host Grotesk for UI; Guttery for logotype only** — typography skills enforce
- **Warm-background rhythm** — `light-beige` canvas alternates with `white` or `beige` cards; avoid gray-on-gray (per Manfred brand guidelines)
- **Flat first, depth is earned** — no heavy shadows, gradients, neumorphism unless functional
- **Mobile first** (principle 12) — design for 320px first; expand
- **Dark mode day-one** (principle 9) — use semantic tokens; dark mode is free
- **Performance is a feature** (principle 13) — typography, illustration, viz skills note bundle / font-loading impact
- **One primary action per view** — visual hierarchy reinforces user intent

### Boundary clarification (`color-system` vs `manfred-design-systems:design-token`)

Both skills enforce the token surface. They serve different units of work:

- **`manfred-design-systems:design-token`** — component-level ("give me CSS for this Card") — already shipped in v0.15
- **`manfred-ui-design:color-system`** — palette / page / surface-level ("colour palette for our new feature page") — shipped here

Same refusal pattern, different unit. Cross-reference between them is mandatory.

### Changed
- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` metadata bumped to `v0.9.0`. `manfred-ui-design` registered as the 12th plugin (first in list — closest to v1.0.0 final ordering).
- `README.md` — added `manfred-ui-design` to install commands and plugin table.

### Attribution
- 8 adapted skills carry attribution footers per `docs/manfred-skill-template.md` rule 8.
- `color-system` is Manfred-original; the mirror's `color-system` provided structural inspiration only — voice, refusal logic, three-layer enforcement, warm-background rhythm, and the (a)/(b)/(c) menu are Manfred-specific.

### Roadmap
- Linear ticket [STU-64](https://linear.app/studio-manfred/issue/STU-64) → Done. Next: [STU-65](https://linear.app/studio-manfred/issue/STU-65) (next mirror plugin per the v1.0.0 plan).

## [0.18.0] — 2026-05-03

### Added
- **`manfred-toolkit` plugin** — Manfred-flavoured designer toolkit mirroring `Owl-Listener/designer-skills/designer-toolkit` (MIT) with Manfred opinions baked in, plus absorbing the LinkedIn trio from `manfred-writing`. **9 skills + 3 commands**:
  - **Adapted (5):** `case-study`, `design-rationale`, `design-system-adoption`, `design-token-audit`, `presentation-deck`. Each carries an attribution footer per `docs/manfred-skill-template.md` rule 8.
  - **Foundational + TDD'd (1):** `ux-writing` — Manfred-original. Built via the full RED → GREEN → REFACTOR loop. RED baseline scored 3/10 — agent used "Oops!", "Hmm,", exclamation stacking ("You're in!"), generic-SaaS-friendly tics, never asked about voice doc, accepted "quick is fine, friendly and on-brand" without context, produced copy that could ship for any signup flow. GREEN closed all 7 failure-mode gaps with: pre-flight requirement to read `~/.claude/shared/manfred-brand.md`, anti-patterns lint (refuses "Oops!", "Hmm,", "Yikes!", "Welcome aboard!", marketing verbs, corporate adjectives, exclamation stacking), errors-explain-don't-blame structure (what happened / what to do / one clear action — user is never the subject of failure), context-required for error copy (refuses generic "something went wrong" — demands real failure mode), CTA rules (specific verb + outcome, not "Submit"/"OK"), the quick-test (read aloud — would I cringe?). REFACTOR scored 9/9; surfaced two patches: replace productivity-deck framing ("5 min of clarification saves 30 min of revision") with the sharper craft argument ("generic copy isn't faster — it's permanent"), and add an explicit rationalisation row covering the engineering-deadline pressure with two faster paths (paste failure modes from code, or ship honest "TODO: copy" placeholders).
  - **Absorbed (3):** `linkedin-reflect`, `linkedin-show-and-tell`, `linkedin-teach` — relocated from `manfred-writing`. Identical content; the versions in `manfred-writing` carry deprecation headers pointing here.
  - **Commands (3):** `/manfred-toolkit:build-presentation`, `/manfred-toolkit:write-case-study`, `/manfred-toolkit:write-rationale`.

### Manfred opinions enforced across the plugin

- **Voice rules from `manfred-brand.md`** — anti-marketing-verb list (transform, empower, leverage, unlock, supercharge, drive, deliver value), anti-corporate-adjective list (cutting-edge, world-class, innovative, best-in-class, passionate), fragments OK, direct second person, concrete over abstract
- **Errors explain, don't blame** — `ux-writing` enforces structure (what happened / what to do / one clear action); user is never the subject of failure
- **CTAs specific verbs with outcomes** — "Get in touch" not "Submit"; "Save changes" not "Save"
- **Quick test** — could I read this aloud without cringing? Run on every output before shipping
- **Customer evidence floor** — case studies, rationales, presentations cite specifically
- **Trade-offs named** — case studies + rationales surface what was given up; without trade-offs, both are propaganda

### Changed
- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` metadata bumped to `v0.8.0`. `manfred-toolkit` registered as the 11th plugin (first in list — closest to v1.0.0 final ordering). `manfred-writing` description updated to flag partial deprecation.
- `manfred-writing/README.md` — full rewrite to reflect partial-deprecation status (linkedin trio + transcript-anonymizer deprecated; only `meeting-summary` active).
- `plugins/manfred-writing/skills/linkedin-reflect/SKILL.md` — deprecation header pointing to `manfred-toolkit:linkedin-reflect`.
- `plugins/manfred-writing/skills/linkedin-show-and-tell/SKILL.md` — deprecation header pointing to `manfred-toolkit:linkedin-show-and-tell`.
- `plugins/manfred-writing/skills/linkedin-teach/SKILL.md` — deprecation header pointing to `manfred-toolkit:linkedin-teach`.
- `README.md` — added `manfred-toolkit` to install commands and plugin table; updated `manfred-writing` row to reflect deprecation status.

### Transitional
- LinkedIn trio lives in BOTH `manfred-writing` and `manfred-toolkit` during v0.18.x. Identical content. `manfred-writing` is removed in v1.0.0 once `meeting-summary` finds a v1.0.0 home (Linear ticket [STU-67](https://linear.app/studio-manfred/issue/STU-67) tracks the v1.0.0 cleanup; `meeting-summary` home decision is unresolved).
- `manfred-writing` remains installable for `meeting-summary` users; the deprecation is partial, not full.

### Attribution
- 5 adapted skills (`case-study`, `design-rationale`, `design-system-adoption`, `design-token-audit`, `presentation-deck`) carry attribution footers per `docs/manfred-skill-template.md` rule 8.
- `ux-writing` is Manfred-original; the mirror's `ux-writing` provided structural inspiration only — voice-doc enforcement, anti-patterns lint, errors-explain-don't-blame structure, context-required-for-errors discipline, and CTA rules are Manfred-specific.
- 3 absorbed LinkedIn skills are Manfred-original (no attribution change needed; they were Manfred-authored when they lived in `manfred-writing`).

### Roadmap
- Linear ticket [STU-63](https://linear.app/studio-manfred/issue/STU-63) → Done. Next: [STU-64](https://linear.app/studio-manfred/issue/STU-64) (next mirror plugin per the v1.0.0 plan).

## [0.17.0] — 2026-05-03

### Added
- **`manfred-design-ops` plugin** — Manfred-flavoured design ops mirroring `Owl-Listener/designer-skills/design-ops` (MIT) with Manfred opinions baked in. **7 skills + 3 commands**:
  - **Adapted (6):** `design-critique`, `design-qa-checklist`, `design-review-process`, `design-sprint-plan`, `team-workflow`, `version-control-strategy`. Each carries an attribution footer per `docs/manfred-skill-template.md` rule 8.
  - **Foundational + TDD'd (1):** `handoff-spec` — Manfred-original. Built via the full RED → GREEN → REFACTOR loop. RED baseline scored 0/8 — agent dumped a kitchen-sink spec with hex literals, raw px values, custom components from scratch, no Linear posting, no walk-through ritual, accessibility as footnote, never read `~/.claude/shared/DESIGN.md`. GREEN closed all 8 gaps with: pre-flight reads (DESIGN.md + Linear ticket via MCP), token-first enforcement (no hex, no raw px, no phantom tokens, no default Tailwind palette), reference-existing-components rule, refusal of "dump everything" with hard 300-word cap, mandatory Linear posting via `mcp__linear-server__save_comment` when ticket linked, walk-through scheduling required, accessibility as first-class section. REFACTOR scored 9.5/10; surfaced three patches: hard-gate the 300-word cap (was soft target), tighten the no-Linear-ticket fallback (was silent escape hatch — now requires user choice between push-for-ticket / confirm-internal-only / draft-pending-ticket), tighten Manfred Lens voice slip ("doesn't apply directly. But:" → direct statement).
  - **Commands (3):** `/manfred-design-ops:handoff` (pre-handoff review → token check → spec → Linear post → walk-through), `/manfred-design-ops:plan-sprint` (challenge framing → Day-0 checklist → 5-day schedule → recruit → test plan → follow-up), `/manfred-design-ops:setup-workflow` (5-component workflow setup, scaled to team size, documented in 2+ visible places).

### Manfred opinions enforced across the plugin

- **Trio attends cross-functional rituals** — PM + designer + tech lead at design reviews, critiques, retros, planning; not designer-solo
- **Design system is source of truth** — handoffs reference tokens not screenshots; QA verifies token compliance not memory
- **Linear is the delivery channel** — handoffs, design reviews, QA findings, sprint summaries all post via `mcp__linear-server__save_comment`
- **Async-first, sync earned** — most "quick syncs" should be Linear comments + Loom; sync for tension resolution, not coordination
- **Accessibility hard gate at every review** (design principle 5; WCAG 2.2 AA non-negotiable) — runtime gate via `manfred-design-systems:a11y-qa`
- **Handoff specs tight** — ~300-word hard cap on intent + decisions + open questions; Figma is the measurement source, not the spec doc
- **Kitchen-sink specs refused** — completeness theatre is worse than a tight spec engineering reads end-to-end

### Changed
- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` metadata bumped to `v0.7.0`. `manfred-design-ops` registered as the 10th plugin (first in list — closest to v1.0.0 final ordering).
- `README.md` — added `manfred-design-ops` to the install commands and plugin table.

### Note
- v0.16.0 CHANGELOG mentioned "Next: STU-62 manfred-ui-design" — that was incorrect. STU-62 is `manfred-design-ops` (this release). `manfred-ui-design` is a later ticket. Linear is the source of truth for ticket → plugin mapping.

### Attribution
- 6 adapted skills carry attribution footers per `docs/manfred-skill-template.md` rule 8.
- `handoff-spec` is Manfred-original; the mirror's version provided structural inspiration only — the Linear MCP integration, the hard 300-word cap, the existing-component reference rule, and the walk-through scheduling are Manfred-specific.

### Roadmap
- Linear ticket [STU-62](https://linear.app/studio-manfred/issue/STU-62) → Done. Next: [STU-63](https://linear.app/studio-manfred/issue/STU-63) (next mirror plugin per the v1.0.0 plan).

## [0.16.0] — 2026-05-03

### Added
- **`manfred-ux-strategy` plugin** — Manfred-flavoured UX strategy work mirroring `Owl-Listener/designer-skills/ux-strategy` (MIT) with Manfred opinions baked in. **8 skills + 3 commands**:
  - **Adapted (6):** `competitive-analysis`, `design-brief`, `experience-map`, `metrics-definition`, `opportunity-framework`, `stakeholder-alignment`. Each carries an attribution footer per `docs/manfred-skill-template.md` rule 8.
  - **Fresh (1):** `north-star-vision` — Manfred-original. Customer-driven floor, "what we give up" non-optional, scenarios as narratives not bullet points, ethics test against principle 6. The mirror's `north-star-vision` provided structural inspiration only — voice, refusal logic, trade-off enforcement are Manfred-specific.
  - **Foundational + TDD'd (1):** `design-principles` — built via the full RED → GREEN → REFACTOR loop. RED baseline scored ~1/7 — agent invented 5 cold-start fintech principles without checking Manfred's canonical 15, accepted "quick is fine, meeting tomorrow" without pushback, skipped prioritisation, mixed in aspirational mush ("delight the user"). GREEN closed those gaps with: pre-flight requirement to read `~/.claude/shared/design-principles.md`, refusal of cold-start posters, (a)/(b)/(c) menu (adapt canonical 15 / meeting prep kit / starter set with workshop date), testable + trade-off-stated requirement per principle, customer-driven + ethics floors as non-negotiable. REFACTOR scored 6/6; surfaced two patches: required side-by-side canonical-vs-adapted check in Scenario D (stops "adapting" from becoming "quietly inventing"), and explicit guardrail that workshop-date is mandatory for the starter-set escape hatch.
  - **Commands (3):** `/manfred-ux-strategy:benchmark` (competitive-analysis → experience-map → opportunity-framework), `/manfred-ux-strategy:frame-problem` (design-brief end-to-end), `/manfred-ux-strategy:strategize` (full strategy: principles → vision → competitive → opportunities → metrics → stakeholders).

### Manfred opinions enforced across the plugin

- **Customer-driven floor** (design principle 1) — every skill cites or flags evidence; "we believe…" gets surfaced as assumption
- **Outcomes over outputs** — success criteria measure user/business changes, not feature lists; opportunities phrased as outcomes ("reduce abandonment 38%→15%") not outputs ("build a progress indicator")
- **Warm + precise voice** — anti-pattern check against marketing verbs (transform, empower, leverage, supercharge, unlock, drive value)
- **Critical & ethical** (design principle 6) — every strategy/brief includes "what does this design do in the world?" + harm check; non-negotiable
- **Triangulation over single-framework certainty** — opportunity-framework runs impact-effort + RICE; disagreements become first-class outputs
- **Trade-offs stated** — visions name what they give up; principles name their trade-off partner; opportunities have stated confidence

### Changed
- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` metadata bumped to `v0.6.0`. `manfred-ux-strategy` registered as the 9th plugin (first in list — closest to v1.0.0 final ordering).
- `README.md` — added `manfred-ux-strategy` to the install commands and plugin table.

### Attribution
- 6 adapted skills (`competitive-analysis`, `design-brief`, `experience-map`, `metrics-definition`, `opportunity-framework`, `stakeholder-alignment`) carry attribution footers per `docs/manfred-skill-template.md` rule 8.
- `design-principles` and `north-star-vision` are Manfred-original; the mirror's versions provided structural inspiration only — voice, refusal logic, Manfred-15 anchoring, and trade-off enforcement are Manfred-specific.

### Roadmap
- Linear ticket [STU-61](https://linear.app/studio-manfred/issue/STU-61) → Done. Next: [STU-62 manfred-ui-design](https://linear.app/studio-manfred/issue/STU-62).

## [0.15.0] — 2026-05-03

### Added
- **`manfred-design-systems` plugin** — Manfred-flavoured design systems work mirroring `Owl-Listener/designer-skills/design-systems` (MIT) with Manfred opinions baked in. **10 skills + 3 commands**:
  - **Adapted (6):** `component-spec`, `documentation-template`, `icon-system`, `naming-convention`, `pattern-library`, `theming-system`. Each carries an attribution footer per `docs/manfred-skill-template.md` rule 8. (The mirror's `accessibility-audit` was skipped per Linear ticket [STU-60](https://linear.app/studio-manfred/issue/STU-60) — `a11y-qa` already covers the runtime gate.)
  - **Foundational + TDD'd (1):** `design-token` — built via the full RED → GREEN → REFACTOR loop. RED baseline scored 0/7 — agent hardcoded six hex literals, used Tailwind's default palette, ignored dark mode, and accepted "I'm in a hurry" without pushback. GREEN added: pre-flight requirement to read `~/.claude/shared/DESIGN.md`, hard rules against raw hex / default Tailwind palette / phantom tokens, the (a)/(b)/(c) refusal menu when a semantic doesn't exist (add token / reuse semantic / neutral + icon). REFACTOR pressure-test scored 6/6; surfaced two patches: time-cost annotation on option (a) so users don't read it as "blocked indefinitely" (added "(15–30 min, not blocked indefinitely)") and an explicit rationalisation row covering the `var(--token-that-doesnt-exist)` reframe.
  - **Absorbed (3):** `a11y-design`, `a11y-dev`, `a11y-qa` — relocated from `manfred-a11y`. Cross-references inside the skills updated to fully-qualified `manfred-design-systems:` form per template rule 6. `manfred-a11y` carries a deprecation note pointing here; both ship in v0.15.x and `manfred-a11y` is removed in v1.0.0.
  - **Commands (3):** `/manfred-design-systems:audit-system` (project-wide compliance scan), `/manfred-design-systems:create-component` (spec → tokens → impl → docs → a11y gate), `/manfred-design-systems:tokenize` (replace hardcoded values with semantic tokens).

### Manfred opinions enforced across the plugin

- **Tokens from `~/.claude/shared/DESIGN.md`** — three-layer architecture (primitives → semantic → shadcn contract). No raw hex, no default Tailwind palette, no inventing missing semantics.
- **Business-blue + human-pink + warm neutrals** — Manfred's palette doesn't ship `success`/`warning`/`info`. The skill refuses to invent and offers (a)/(b)/(c).
- **WCAG 2.2 AA baseline** (design principle 5) — every component / pattern skill checks this floor.
- **shadcn shapes are the contract** (design principle 10) — component specs mirror stock shadcn API where one exists.
- **Dark mode day-one** (`~/.claude/shared/DESIGN.md` Section 9) — semantic tokens flip automatically; brand utilities stay literal; pair literal-brand surfaces with absolute foregrounds.

### Changed
- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` metadata bumped to `v0.5.0`. `manfred-design-systems` registered as the 8th plugin (first in list — closest to v1.0.0 final ordering).
- `manfred-a11y` description prefixed with **DEPRECATED** in marketplace.json — skills moved to `manfred-design-systems`; plugin removed in v1.0.0.
- `plugins/manfred-dev/skills/test-my-code/SKILL.md` — cross-reference updated from bare `a11y-qa` to fully-qualified `manfred-design-systems:a11y-qa` (gate 7 + Tools-used section).
- `plugins/manfred-dev/skills/release/SKILL.md` — three references updated from `superpowers:a11y-qa` (typo from earlier era) and bare `a11y-qa` to `manfred-design-systems:a11y-qa` (prerequisites, gate 5, Cross-references section).
- `plugins/manfred-dev/README.md` — Cross-plugin dependencies section now points at `manfred-design-systems`; legacy migration note included.
- `README.md` — added `manfred-design-systems` to the install commands and plugin table; flagged `manfred-a11y` as deprecated.

### Transitional
- `a11y-design`, `a11y-dev`, `a11y-qa` live in BOTH `manfred-a11y` and `manfred-design-systems` during v0.15.x. Identical content. `manfred-a11y` is removed in v1.0.0 (Linear ticket [STU-67](https://linear.app/studio-manfred/issue/STU-67)).
- Users with `manfred-a11y` installed should also install `manfred-design-systems` so `manfred-dev` cross-references resolve. After verifying the new plugin works, `manfred-a11y` can be uninstalled.

### Attribution
- 6 adapted skills (`component-spec`, `documentation-template`, `icon-system`, `naming-convention`, `pattern-library`, `theming-system`) carry attribution footers per `docs/manfred-skill-template.md` rule 8.
- `design-token` is Manfred-original; the source mirror's `design-token` provided structural inspiration only (categories, tier names) — voice, refusal logic, three-layer-architecture enforcement, and the (a)/(b)/(c) menu are Manfred-specific.
- Three absorbed a11y skills are Manfred-original (no attribution change needed; they were Manfred-authored when they lived in `manfred-a11y`).

### Roadmap
- Linear ticket [STU-60](https://linear.app/studio-manfred/issue/STU-60) → Done. Next: [STU-61 manfred-ux-strategy](https://linear.app/studio-manfred/issue/STU-61).

## [0.14.0] — 2026-04-30

### Added
- **`manfred-design-research` plugin** — Manfred-flavoured user research mirroring `Owl-Listener/designer-skills/design-research` (MIT) with Manfred opinions baked in. **11 skills + 4 commands**:
  - **Adapted (9):** `summarize-interview`, `affinity-diagram`, `card-sort-analysis`, `diary-study-plan`, `empathy-map`, `jobs-to-be-done`, `usability-test-plan`, `journey-map`. Each carries an attribution footer per `docs/manfred-skill-template.md` rule 8.
  - **Fresh (1):** `user-archetype` — Manfred-original. Chosen over "user persona" to sidestep the projection / bias / fabrication failure modes common in persona work. No invented names, photos, or biographical detail; behavioural attributes only.
  - **Foundational + TDD'd (1):** `interview-script` — built via the full RED → GREEN → REFACTOR loop. RED baseline showed the typical agent writes hypothetical-future questions, blurs discovery and usability, and skips Trio attendance / recording / compensation. GREEN closed those gaps. REFACTOR pressure-test surfaced 3 patches: tighten Phase 1 escape hatch (require user pushback before the TBD escape), tighten Phase 2 "Both" combine path (require pushback before the escape hatch), and add a 24-hour-timeline rationalization row ("session is tomorrow, I'll sort logistics in the morning" → reschedule).
  - **Absorbed (1):** `transcript-anonymizer` — relocated from `manfred-writing`. Identical content; the version in `manfred-writing` carries a deprecation note pointing here.
  - **Commands (4):** `/manfred-design-research:discover`, `/manfred-design-research:interview`, `/manfred-design-research:synthesize`, `/manfred-design-research:test-plan` — orchestrators using fully-qualified skill references per template rule 6.

### Manfred opinions enforced across the plugin

- **Research isn't a phase** (design principle 2) — every skill ties back to continuous discovery cadence
- **Trio attendance** — interview / usability skills enforce PM + designer + tech lead, not solo research
- **Story-based interviewing** (Torres) — refuses leading + hypothetical questions
- **Pay people for their time** — recruit guidance includes incentives
- **Accessible first** (design principle 5) — recruit + test design include disabled / AT users; no skill leaves accessibility as a follow-up

### Changed
- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` metadata bumped to `v0.4.0`. `manfred-design-research` registered as the 7th plugin.
- `README.md` — added `manfred-design-research` to the install commands and plugin table; flagged `manfred-writing:transcript-anonymizer` as deprecated.
- `plugins/manfred-writing/skills/transcript-anonymizer/SKILL.md` — added deprecation note pointing to the new home.

### Transitional
- `transcript-anonymizer` lives in BOTH `manfred-writing` and `manfred-design-research` during v0.14.x. Identical content. The `manfred-writing` version is removed in v1.0.0 (Linear ticket [STU-67](https://linear.app/studio-manfred/issue/STU-67)).
- Existing `manfred-writing:meeting-summary` was *not* moved — per Linear ticket [STU-59](https://linear.app/studio-manfred/issue/STU-59) edits, that skill is destined for a different plugin (TBD) rather than `manfred-design-research`.

### Attribution
- 9 adapted skills carry attribution footers per `docs/manfred-skill-template.md` rule 8.
- `user-archetype` is Manfred-original; structurally inspired by `user-persona` in `Owl-Listener/designer-skills` but reframed end-to-end.

### Roadmap
- Linear ticket [STU-59](https://linear.app/studio-manfred/issue/STU-59) → Done. Next: [STU-60 manfred-design-systems](https://linear.app/studio-manfred/issue/STU-60).

## [0.13.0] — 2026-04-30

### Added
- **`manfred-discovery` plugin** — Manfred-flavoured product discovery synthesising Marty Cagan's four product risks and Teresa Torres's continuous discovery + opportunity-solution trees. 7 skills + 3 commands:
  - Skills: `cagan-risks`, `opportunity-solution-tree`, `assumption-test`, `customer-touchpoint-plan`, `product-brief`, `discovery-readout`, `discovery-rituals`
  - Commands: `/manfred-discovery:kickoff`, `/manfred-discovery:weekly`, `/manfred-discovery:risk-check`
  - `discovery-readout` integrates with Linear via `mcp__linear-server__save_comment` (pattern from `manfred-dev:test-my-code`)
  - `cagan-risks` built via the full TDD-for-skills loop in `superpowers:writing-skills` (RED baseline → GREEN → REFACTOR with three rationalization patches)
- **`docs/manfred-skill-template.md`** — codified Manfred SKILL.md conventions: voice rules, Cagan/Torres lens guidance, Manfred-outputs checklist, TDD-for-skills pointer, attribution rules. Reference for all subsequent Manfred plugins.

### Changed
- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` metadata bumped to `v0.3.0`. `manfred-discovery` registered as the 6th plugin.
- `README.md` — added `manfred-discovery` to the plugin table, documented the v1.0.0 design-discipline reorg roadmap (mirrors of `Owl-Listener/designer-skills` plugins, with absorption of existing utility plugins).

### Transitional
- `manfred-product:brief-prd` (Scandic-specific) and `manfred-discovery:product-brief` (generalised, with explicit Cagan/Torres hooks) coexist in v0.13.x. `brief-prd` carries a deprecation note. The full reorg lands in v1.0.0 — `manfred-product` removed, `brief-prd` content fully migrated.

### Roadmap
- v1.0.0 will reorg into 11 themed plugins replacing both the existing 5 utility plugins and the third-party `Owl-Listener/designer-skills` install. See README "Roadmap" section.

### Attribution
- Inspiration for the plugin/command structure (and several upcoming mirror plugins) draws from [Owl-Listener/designer-skills](https://github.com/Owl-Listener/designer-skills) — MIT licensed. The `manfred-discovery` plugin itself is Manfred-original; mirror plugins (when they ship) will be structurally adapted with Manfred voice and opinions.

## [0.12.0] — 2026-04-30

### Changed
- **Skills now ship as plugins.** Migrated 14 skills from the loose `skills/<name>/` layout into 5 themed plugins under `plugins/<plugin-name>/`. The marketplace at `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` now lists `manfred-a11y`, `manfred-writing`, `manfred-product`, `manfred-dev`, and `manfred-knowledge` (each at `v0.1.0`). Marketplace metadata bumped to `v0.2.0`.
- `install.sh` no longer copies skills. It now installs only the home `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` and `~/.claude/shared/` reference docs, then prints the `/plugin install` commands. A new `check_legacy_skills` step warns users with leftover copies in `~/.claude/skills/` and prints the cleanup commands.
- `README.md` rewritten around the plugin-first install flow with a per-plugin table and a migration section for users coming from `install.sh`-installed skills.
- Top-level `skills/` directory removed — all skills now live under `plugins/<plugin>/skills/`.

### Added
- `plugins/manfred-dev/skills/test-my-code/` — opinionated pre-merge QA gate for Vite/React features (typecheck → lint → vitest → build → Playwright → axe). Saves a report file and posts the summary to the linked Linear ticket. Built today via the full TDD-for-skills loop. Calls into `manfred-a11y`'s `a11y-qa` for the runtime accessibility scan.
- `plugins/manfred-knowledge/skills/clippings-linter/` — Obsidian vault hygiene (broken notes, missing tags, duplicates, orphans). Includes Python lint scripts.

### Migration
Existing users with `~/.claude/skills/<name>/` from previous `install.sh` runs: re-run `install.sh` once — it detects the legacy directories and prints the cleanup commands. Then `rm -rf ~/.claude/skills/<name>` for each affected skill and `/plugin install manfred-<plugin>@manfred` to pick up the plugin-distributed version.

## [0.11.0] — 2026-04-29

### Added
- `skills/release` — full production release skill that runs quality gates (lint, types+build, unit tests, a11y audit), waits for the Vercel deploy to reach `READY` after pushing, then comments + transitions Linear tickets and updates Linear Project descriptions. Sibling to the lightweight `deploy` skill — use `release` for projects with Vercel-GitHub deploys and `STU-###` tickets, `deploy` for everything else. Includes `references/linear-actions.md` (verified Linear MCP call patterns including the Linear Project vs project-Milestone distinction) and `references/vercel-wait.md` (deployment polling pattern). Built via the full TDD-for-skills loop in `superpowers:writing-skills` — three baseline pressure scenarios (just-ship-it, Linear-stale, typo-fix) drove the rationalization table; three REFACTOR scenarios verified compliance and surfaced two cosmetic-fast-path ambiguities that were patched.
- `MEMORY.md` — repo-level self-learning log with a "Standing lessons" section (TDD-for-skills, Linear MCP gotchas, Vercel-GitHub deploy mechanics, repo conventions) and dated session entries. Read on session start, append on session close, promote recurring lessons.

### Changed
- `README.md` skills table now lists 12 skills; `deploy` row clarified as "lightweight"; new `release` row added.
- `install.sh` and `uninstall.sh` `SKILLS=( … )` arrays include `release`.

## [0.3.4] — 2026-04-29

### Changed
- Repository moved from `jens-wedin/manfred-shared-knowledge` to `Studio-Manfred/manfred-shared-knowledge`. All install/uninstall URLs, marketplace registration command, and cross-references in `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `install.sh`, `uninstall.sh`, `shared/home-claude.md`, `shared/manfred-brand.md`, and `shared/DESIGN.md` updated to the new org.
- `skills/deploy/SKILL.md` — git tag step (Step 7) is now part of the standard flow rather than optional, since downstream releases consistently rely on tags.

## [0.3.2] — 2026-04-19

### Changed
- `shared/manfred-brand.md` Brand Voice section rewritten with prescriptive tone-of-voice guidance: concrete rhythms lifted from `studiomanfred.com` (Q&A beats, shrug ellipsis, serious-serious-wink triplets, provocation-where-a-pitch-would-go), a Manfred Vocabulary list (Manfred Magic, the Mmmms, peeps, 〰️, Ping us), a named Anti-Patterns list (no marketing verbs, no corporate adjectives, no "we're passionate about…", no forced levity, no hedging), and a four-question Quick Test for new copy. The previous version described the voice; this one shows it.

## [0.3.1] — 2026-04-19

### Changed
- `shared/manfred-brand.md` rewritten after auditing `studiomanfred.com` — real mission ("Building Better Product Companies" / "make the product world more customer driven"), actual services (Leadership · Customer Research · Product/UX/Service Design · Training), the team ("the Mmmms": Jens Wedin, Selma Hallqvist, Axel Nathorst-Böös, Moa Bogren), named clients (Boka Direkt · Mentimeter · Fishbrain · Svea Bank · Trygg-Hansa), and the playful/craft-serious site voice ("Manfred Magic", "winging it with a whiteboard", "ping us"). Colors and typography retained under a new "Visual Language" section.
- `shared/design-principles.md` expanded from 12 to 15 principles: added Customer-Driven, Research Isn't a Phase, Craft Seriously (Yourself Not So Much), Critical & Ethical Design — reflecting Manfred's actual practice (training courses include Critical Design, Product Discovery, Customer Journey Mapping). The existing design-system principles (tokens, dark mode, shadcn shapes, accessibility) retained.
- `shared/DESIGN.md` opening reframed to make clear this describes the Manfred design system (one artifact the studio makes), not the studio itself — pointers to `manfred-brand.md` and `design-principles.md` added.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-04-19

### Added
- `shared/DESIGN.md` — full Manfred design system specification (colors, typography, components, dark mode, accessibility), sourced from `github.com/Studio-Manfred/manfred-design_system`
- `shared/design-principles.md` — 12-principle decision framework for Manfred work
- `install.sh` now installs DESIGN.md and design-principles.md alongside manfred-brand.md
- `uninstall.sh` removes DESIGN.md and design-principles.md

### Changed
- `shared/manfred-brand.md` rewritten with real content (brand thesis, values, voice, color palette, typography), replacing the v0.1.0 placeholder
- README "What gets installed" table updated with DESIGN.md and design-principles.md rows

## [0.2.0] — 2026-04-19

### Added
- Bundled 11 Manfred skills under `skills/`: `a11y-design`, `a11y-dev`, `a11y-qa`, `brief-prd`, `deploy`, `linkedin-reflect`, `linkedin-show-and-tell`, `linkedin-teach`, `markitdown-convert`, `meeting-summary`, `transcript-anonymizer`
- `install.sh` now performs a shallow `git clone` to fetch multi-file skills and copies them into `~/.claude/skills/<name>/`
- `install.sh` errors clearly when `git` is not on `PATH`
- `uninstall.sh` removes installed skill directories (honours `--yes` and the TTY guard)
- README documents the 11 bundled skills and the planned plugin migration

### Changed
- README "What gets installed" table now includes the skills row
- `install.sh` honours optional `MANFRED_REPO_GIT` env var for testing against a local checkout

## [0.1.1] — 2026-04-19

### Fixed
- `uninstall.sh` piped via `curl | bash` now errors clearly with a `--yes` hint instead of silently aborting on consumed stdin
- README uninstall command updated to pass `-s -- --yes` so `curl | bash` works end-to-end

### Added
- `*.backup.*` to `.gitignore` (installer backup files)
- Contributing guide entry for `shared/roles/` playbooks

## [0.1.0] — 2026-04-19

### Added
- Initial scaffold: `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, `install.sh`, `uninstall.sh`
- Placeholder home-level `CLAUDE.md` installed via `shared/home-claude.md`
- Placeholder `shared/manfred-brand.md`
- Project-level `CLAUDE.md` template at repo root
- Empty `skills/`, `commands/`, `plugins/`, `shared/roles/` directories ready for content
- README with install, contribute, and uninstall instructions
